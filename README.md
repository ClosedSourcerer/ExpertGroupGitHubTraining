- star a repository
  - mark it as a favorite
- watch a repository
  - request email notification
- fork a repository
  - create a copy that is still linked to the original
    - used to make pseudo backups
    - used to start your own thing based on someon elses work

## Branches

- Repositories start with the main branch
  - used to be called master
    - used to be called trunk
- If you create a new branch you must choose an existing branch as the basis for the new one.
- Better to only create branches from main and also merge them back only into main
