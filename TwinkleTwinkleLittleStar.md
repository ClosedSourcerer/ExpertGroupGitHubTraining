{energy emmiting action}, {energy emmiting action}, {size} {celestial body},
how I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high
like a {state of carbon} in the sky.
{energy emmiting action}, {energy emmiting action} {size} {celestial body},
how I wonder what you are.

When the blazing sun is gone,
when the nothing shines upon,
then you show your {size} light.
{energy emmiting action}, {energy emmiting action}, all the night.
{energy emmiting action}, {energy emmiting action}, {size} {celestial body},
how I wonder what you are.
